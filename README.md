#TwitterSentiment

A demonstration app that accompanied my SwiftLondon talk ["ReactiveCocoa and Swift, Better Together"](http://www.meetup.com/swiftlondon/events/202054752/)

This demo app searches Twitter, combining search results with sentiment analysis via a free online API courtesy of [loudelement](http://loudelement.com).
